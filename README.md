## Contexte

This repository was developed as a student assignment for the course **101 - Imperative Programming** at HES‑SO Valais‑Wallis (ISC section). It was created at the end of the first semester to practice core imperative programming concepts (control structures, data structures, input/output), basic game mechanics implementation, and simple AI behaviors.
